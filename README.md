A few interesting projects based on machine learning algorithms and more specific, using prediction on number patterns or sequence.
   The projects are inspired mainly from the Microsoft documentation and I complete them in order to boost my knowledge 
in machine learning technologies as ML.NET. 
   Similarly I've started a project with the theme of 'predict covid 19 cases' on a specific time period and it just remained a prototype 
of the Project3, further to be developed and happy to receive collaborators on it.
